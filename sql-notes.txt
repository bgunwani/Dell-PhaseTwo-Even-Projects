Working with Database: (Microsoft SQL Server)

Constraints in SQL Server:

	1. Primary Key - No Null Values, No Duplicate Values
	2. Not Null - No Null Values
	3. Check - To restrict the data with conditions
	4. Unique - No Duplicate Values including Null
	5. Foreign Key - To create referential Integrity
	6. Default - Default value for specific column

Joins in SQL Server:

	1. Inner Join / Default Join / Equi Join
		(Only fetches the matched records from both tables)
	2. Outer Join (Left / Right / Full)
	Left Outer Join
	(All records from Left and Only matched records from Right)
	Right Outer Join
	(All records from Right and Only matched records from Left)
	Full Outer Join
	(All matched and unmatched records from both tables)
	4. Self Join(A table Join Itself)
	5. Cross Join (Cartesian Product)
		(Each Record of Left Table gets multiplied by each record of right table)
		Cross Join gets applied implicitly when:
		a. A join condition is ommitted.
		b. A join condition is not valid.
